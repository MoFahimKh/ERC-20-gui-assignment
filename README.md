Simple ERC20 Token Wallet
This is a simple ERC20 token wallet built with React and ethers.js. It allows you to connect your MetaMask wallet and interact with the deployed ERC20 token smart contract on the Ethereum network.

##Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`.
Start the application using the command `npm start`.
Connect your MetaMask wallet to the application.
Usage
Once you have connected your MetaMask wallet to the application, you can view your token balance and interact with the smart contract by sending or approving tokens.

##The application has three forms:

Transfer Coins: Allows you to send tokens to another address.
Approve Tokens: Allows you to approve another address to spend tokens on your behalf.
Transfer From: Allows an approved address to spend tokens on your behalf.
Fill in the required fields in each form and click on the corresponding button to interact with the smart contract.
